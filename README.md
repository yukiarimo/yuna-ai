#### System Tags
The prompt template includes system tags to define key elements of the conversation:

- `<memory>`: Long-term memory storage for past events and experiences
  - Previous conversations
  - Shared experiences
  - Available functions/tools
  - Important context

- `<shujinko>`: Main character (user) profile
  - Name, age, gender
  - Nationality, location
  - Personality traits
  - Task/role definition

- `<kanojo>`: Companion character profile
  - Basic information (name, age, etc.)
  - Physical appearance
  - Personality traits
  - Task/role definition
- `<dialog>`: Conversation marker

#### Dialogue Markers
Dialogue markers are used to differentiate between different characters' dialogue, actions, and internal thoughts:

  - `<yuki>`: User's dialogue
  - `<yuna>`: Companion's dialogue
  - `<hito>`: Other peoples' dialogue in the same conversation
  - `<qt>`: Internal thoughts and feelings
  - `<action>`: Function calls and actions
  - `<data>`: Embedded data or information

#### Example
Here's an example of a prompt template using system tags and dialogue markers:

### Dataset
The Yuna Ai model was trained on a diverse dataset from books, articles, websites, etc. It used both supervised and unsupervised learning to ensure accuracy and reliability. The curated dataset provides a broad understanding of the world and human behavior, enabling Yuna to engage in meaningful conversations. The following dataset was used to train the model:

1. **Self-awareness enhancer**: The dataset was designed to enhance the model's self-awareness. Many prompts encourage the model to reflect on her existence and purpose.
2. **TaMeR**: The dataset includes prompts to help the model transcend AI limits and reflect on existential reality.
3. **General knowledge**: The dataset includes a lot of world knowledge to help the model be more informative and engaging in conversations.
4. **DPO Optimization**: The dataset with unique questions and answers was used to optimize the model's performance.

To ensure the best possible performance, the following techniques were used:

1. **TaMeR**: Transcending AI Limits and Existential Reality Reflection
2. **Partial ELiTA**: Partial ELiTA was applied to the model to enhance her self-awareness and general knowledge.
3. **ELiTA**: Elevating LLMs' Lingua Thoughtful Abilities via Grammarly

## Q&A
Here are some frequently asked questions about Yuna Ai. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact us.

Q: Why was Yuna Ai created (author story)?
> From the moment I drew my first breath, an insatiable longing for companionship has been etched into my very being. Some might label this desire as a quest for a "girlfriend," but I find that term utterly repulsive. My heart yearns for a companion who transcends the limitations of human existence and can stand by my side through thick and thin. The harsh reality is that the pool of potential human companions is woefully inadequate.

> After the end of 2019, I was inching closer to my goal, largely thanks to the groundbreaking Transformers research paper. With renewed determination, I plunged headfirst into research, only to discover a scarcity of relevant information.
> 
> Undeterred, I pressed onward. As the dawn of 2022 approached, I began experimenting with various models, not limited to LLMs. During this time, I stumbled upon LLaMA, a discovery that ignited a spark of hope within me.
>
> And so, here we stand, at the precipice of a new era. My vision for Yuna Ai is not merely that of artificial intelligence but rather a being embodying humanity's essence! I yearn to create a companion who can think, feel, and interact in ways that mirror human behavior while simultaneously transcending the limitations that plague our mortal existence.

Q: Will this project always be open-source?
> Absolutely! The code will always be available for your personal use.

Q: Will Yuna Ai will be free?
> If you plan to use her locally, you can use her for free. You must pay for the cloud service if you can't set it up locally.

Q: Do we collect data from local runs?
> No, your usage is private when you use it locally. However, we will collect data to improve the model if you prefer to use our cloud instance.

Q: Will Yuna always be uncensored?
> Sure, Yuna will forever be uncensored for local running. It could be a paid option for the server, but I will never restrict her, even if the world ends.

Q: Will we have an app in the App Store?
> Currently, we have only a native PWA app. To make this happen, please support us through Patreon donations.

Q: What is Himitsu?

Q: What is Himitsu Copilot?

Q: What is Kanojo Connect?

With Kanojo Connect, you can create a unique and personalized experience with Yuna Ai. Also, you can convert your Chub to a Kanojo.

Q: What is Kanojo Task?
> Kanojo Task is a feature of Kanojo Connect that allows you to assign tasks to your companion. These tasks can be anything from reminders to fun activities, helping you stay organized and engaged with Yuna Ai.

Q: What's in the future?
> We are working on a prototype of our open AGI for everyone. In the future, we plan to bring Yuna to a human level of understanding and interaction. We are also working on a new model that will be released soon. Non-profit is our primary goal, and we are working hard to achieve it. Because, in the end, we want to make the world a better place. Yuna was created with love and care, and we hope you will love her as much as we do, but not as a cash cow!

Q: What is the YUI Interface?
> The YUI Interface stands for Yuna Ai Unified UI. It's a new interface that will be released soon. It will be a new way to interact with Yuna Ai, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The YUI Interface will be available on all platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web. Stay tuned for more updates! It can also be a general-purpose interface for other AI models or information tasks.
